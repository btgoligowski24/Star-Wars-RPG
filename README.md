# unit-4-game

## What is this?
This is a very basic rpg game where a person chooses a character and tries to defeat the remaining enemies. It's mobile responsive and should work on all screens sizes.

## Why is this useful?
This is useful for me to track my progress in my coding boot camp and remember some of the stuff I've done in the past. It may also be helpful to other new coders to see possible ways to do things.

## How to get started?
Follow the instructions on the screen when you load the game. You'll start by selecting a hero that you want to play. Then, you will select which enemy you want to fight first. If you defeat that enemy, you select another to fight and so on.

## Where to get help?
You can reach out to me diretly, but I make no claims as to how quickly I'll get back to you. The best bet is to just Google what you're stuck on. That's what I did to create this game. W3Schools, Mozilla's Develper Network, and Stack Overflow were really helpful resources.

## Maintence and contributions
This game may be periodically maintained by me and as of this writing, I'm the only contributor to it. My friend John helped with beta/QA testing of this as well.
